<h2>THE SONG</h2>
season in,season out 
<br>This song we have chanted
<br>A song pregnant with chunks of wisdom
<br>A song studied with words of th sages
<br>On how to elude the sharp
<br>Tenacious jaws of this moranding scourge
<p>
Bat sad and disheatening
<br>That season in,season out
<br>The retinue of victims soars
<br>When shall we countrymen
<br>Cease stretching our vocal chords
<br>Chanting the song over and over again
<h2>Analysi</h2>
the persona is probably one of the advisors
<br>who claims that every time people are being
<br>advised on the dangers of HIV/AIDS, these
<br>advices are full of wisdom and come from 
<br>elderly people(sages)
<br>saddening is that every time the number 
<br>of victims continue to rise 
<br>therefore the persona complains as to when
<br>they are going to change their behaviour.
