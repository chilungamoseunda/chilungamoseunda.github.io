<h2>zomba Botanical Gardens</h2>
Perched at the foot of a towering plateou
<br>Beaming delightedly and full of life
<br>With trees clad in cheerful evergreen leaves
<br>A they stand on manicured green carpets
<br>Punctured by a bed of flowers
<br>And a battalion or rocks 
<br>Standing guard there
<p>
<br>Birds ceaselessly  chanting  lullabies
<br>Soft piecing the cemetery silence
<br>The serpent like Mulunguzi snaking through 
<br>Its waters here splashing and there splattering
<br>Surely, Adam and Eve must have walked and played 
<br>Before falling from grace to grass
